## 🚀 About Me
I'm a tech-savvy guy who blends code with faith. I’ve been coding since I was a teen and now I’m diving deeper into the cloud ecosystem to become a future Cloud Engineer or Architect. Passionate about building impactful solutions, I love working with JavaScript, Nuxt, Node.js, and now leveling up with Golang & TypeScript.

Outside of tech, I enjoy memorizing Qur’an, watching romance anime (fav: **Ao no Hako** 💙), and spending time creating creative content.
